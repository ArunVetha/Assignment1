        <img src="Image/tandf.jpg" alt="run" height="350px" width="550px">
        <p>As far as I can remember, I have always participated in track and field. And I'm good at it, nowadays it's of no use since we only 
            get to visit the school for a few days and most physical games are prohibited. And still it's proud to track and field has always helped
            me stay in shape. And I look forward to see more of it.

        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <img src="Image/books.jpg" alt="books" height="350px" width="550px">
        <p>Learning is one of my talents I myself admire. It's always been curiosity that always pushes me forward to explore new things daily
            and it gives me the courage to dive into things and see how things actaully works. And I'm learning each and every day. As most of you
            heard,'Knowlegde is Power' but it's also the feel which would make you feel so, once you are confident that you have learnt something.

        <h2>Playing Games</h2>
        <img src="Image/PS5.jpeg" alt="ps5" height="350px" width="550px">
        <p>Before I started poly or when I had HBL earlier without those assignmets, I used play games a lot with my friend, not a lot of physical
            ones but the console games. I had a lot of time and later it became one of my hobbies, because as I curious, those games probably intrigue me
            sometimes. Like those mechanics behind it, attention to details and so on forth.

        <h2>Watching Netflix And Movies</h2>
        <img src="Image/netflix.jpg" alt="netflix" height="350px" width="550px">
        <p>Watching shows are a great time passer and I only do it if i have time to spare. It's always makes me feel not anti social. sometimes
            shows or movies may or can be educative, leisure or fun, it really depends on one's mindset. My favourite genre is investigative and fantasy. 
            And some of my gavourite movies include: the inception and Da Vinci Code.
